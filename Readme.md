# Spelltower solver

Simple program that can find the longest words in the iOS game spelltower

A dictionary is required to use this program. I used the 2of12full.txt dictionary:
http://wordlist.aspell.net/alt12dicts-readme/ renamed to dict.txt

test_board reads board1.txt and outputs all the words in desending size that it finds.
